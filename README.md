# MCC-Instances
Here we have the second group of synthetic instances presented in the online supplementary of the paper "Modularity Maximization to Design Contiguous Policy Zones for Pandemic Response" co-authored by Baghersad, M., Emadikhiav, M., Huang, C., Behara, R."

The instances include the randomized mobility and adjacency matrix data betweein counties of different states of the US. Each instance includes two files: 1- stateName_movement.xlsx 2- stateName_adjacency.xlsx 
The first file include mobility information for the state, and the second file contains countiy adjacency matrix. Counties are labeled by their FIPS code.
